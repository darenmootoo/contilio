I used Typescript as this was clearly strongly typed data, and passed down the data from the Dashboard page into the table and the chart component. It was styled with Sass and should be responsive at 500px.

There is a slight issue with the tsconfig which I did not have time to look into, but it does not affect the app. 

To run, please clone, npm i, npm start.
